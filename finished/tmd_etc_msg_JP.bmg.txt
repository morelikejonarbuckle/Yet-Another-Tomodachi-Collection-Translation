Miis can meet up on their
own, talk to each other,
and become friends.


---
id: 1301600
attribute: 0x6400B40001010007
---
Each Mii has different
personalities. It may be
easy to become friends
with some Miis, or hard
with other Miis.


---
id: 1301610
attribute: 0x6400B40001010007
---
Let's take a look at
how different their
personalities are.
They should be
different, in terms
of personality.


---
id: 1301620
attribute: 0x6400B40001010007
---
There are {{255:0 arg="0x0200"}}4 types{{255:0 arg="0x0800"}} of
main traits. Each main trait
is divided into 4 sub-traits.
So there are {{255:0 arg="0x0200"}}16 types{{255:0 arg="0x0800"}}
altogether.


---
id: 1301650
attribute: 0x6400B40001010007
---
Let's compare their
personalities by tapping
on the personality boxes
to see how they differ.


---
id: 1301670
attribute: 0x6400B40001010007
---
Their personalities seem
to be similar. They're
good friends in real life
too, aren't they?


---
id: 1301700
attribute: 0x6400B40001010007
---
So, what are the Miis doing
now? Let's take a peek.

It seems like you are playing
this game on a different DS.
Daily events will stop
and things like store items 
will not change for 24 hours.
