# About
Jon got bored one day and impulsively tried to finish jjjewel's translation. He used something slightly better than Google translate to finish this mod (read the wiki)
Some text might get cut off when you play this ROM hack. Jon might set up a google form to submit errors in case some people don't want to sign up for a Github account

So far, all the bmg files are finished but some of them break the game. Wonder if this is an error with Tinke...

# Project pretty much in jeopardy until Jon can find someone who can take cake of the compression issue
Behold: The comically large roadblock ruining the translation! https://github.com/morelikejonarbuckle/Yet-Another-Tomodachi-Collection-Translation/issues/18 https://github.com/morelikejonarbuckle/Yet-Another-Tomodachi-Collection-Translation/issues/4
