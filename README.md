# Yet-Another-Tomodachi-Collection-Translation
A improved translation of Tomodachi Collection
# About
Jon got bored one day and impulsively tried to finish jjjewel's translation. He used something slightly better than Google translate to finish this mod (read the wiki)
Some text might get cut off when you play this ROM hack. Jon might set up a google form to submit errors in case some people don't want to sign up for a Github account

# Project will likely stop after 0.90 due to Tinke and BMG files

Some people have starred this for some reason, if they want to try translating their own copy here's a neat guide to some textures: https://gbatemp.net/threads/tomodachi-collection-textures-to-replace.675991/
Use this version of Tinke or else the textures refuse to load.

If you have windows use THIS exact copy of MSBT editor, the later updates break the BMG

Best of wishes!
