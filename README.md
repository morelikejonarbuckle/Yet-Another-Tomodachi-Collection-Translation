# About
Jon got bored one day and impulsively tried to finish jjjewel's translation. He used something slightly better than Google translate to finish this mod (read the wiki)
Some text might get cut off when you play this ROM hack. Jon might set up a google form to submit errors in case some people don't want to sign up for a Github account

Some people have starred this for some reason, if they want to try translating their own copy here's a neat guide to some textures: https://gbatemp.net/threads/tomodachi-collection-textures-to-replace.675991/

# Project pretty much paused after the big News update until Jon can find someone who can take cake of the compression issue
Behold: The comically large roadblock ruining the translation! https://github.com/morelikejonarbuckle/Yet-Another-Tomodachi-Collection-Translation/issues/18 https://github.com/morelikejonarbuckle/Yet-Another-Tomodachi-Collection-Translation/issues/4
