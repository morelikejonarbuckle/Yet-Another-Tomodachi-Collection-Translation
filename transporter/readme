The “transporter” folder is a half-baked translation of an 3DS app that allows owners of Tomodachi Collection to send their Miis into Tomodachi Collection: New Life (aka Tomodachi Life (2013)).
I tried to translate these but it won’t allow me to mess with the yes/no buttons. Appreciate it if anyone else can deal with this
Download the app here
